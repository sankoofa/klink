A lightweight Discord bot written in **Python** that automatically detects and enhances links from **GitHub** and **Twitter/X** — fetching code snippets and re-embedding tweets with style and precision.

## ✨ Features

- **GitHub Line Snippets** → Detects GitHub links with line references (e.g. `#L15` or `#L10-L20`) and returns syntax-highlighted snippets.  
- **Twitter/X Post Enhancer** → Replaces default Discord embeds with custom blue embeds featuring author info, tweet text, replies, quotes, and media (videos prioritized).  
- **Modular Design** → Organized into self-contained cogs for easy extension and maintenance.  
- **Rate Limiting & Error Handling** → Prevents spam and gracefully handles API failures.  
- **Multi-Line & Media Support** → Handles code ranges, images, videos, and quoted/replied tweets seamlessly.
